          As developers and designers who create websites, we need to make websites that are accessible to everyone.
          People with ASD have the right to access and engage with online content just like any other user. If the way
          we design a site is barring them from doing so, it's on us to make sure that they can access and use our site.
          It's necessary to design sites so that everyone has an equal opportunity to access information, services, and
          resources.

        <h2 class="pb-3"><mark>Tips on how to interact with people with ASD through websites and website design</mark></h2>
        <h3>First, one tip as a foreword.</h3>
        <p>We need to remember that everyone with ASD is different since ASD affects everyone differently. ASD is a
          spectrum in many ways. For example, some people might struggle with communication– <a
            href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34495269/" target=”_blank”>an estimated 25-30% of
            individuals</a> with ASD are nonverbal or minimally verbal. Others might have no trouble with talking. So,
          while
          the following points might address something that significantly affects some people with ASD, no one point can
          encompass the needs of everyone with ASD. Accessibility is not a feature; it's a requirement. And, adding one
          component that might help some people with ASD won't necessarily help all.
        </p>
        <h3>Tips on website design that can help us get our content across clearer to individuals with ASD</h3>
        <p>
          First, provide instructions or help guides. Break down complex tasks
          into manageable steps and use visual aids or multimedia elements to reinforce understanding. Providing
          explicit instructions can help people with ASD navigate the website more independently. Provide options to
          get help when necessary.

              </div>
            </div>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Next, use simple and straightforward language in the website's content. Avoid jargon, complex sentence
          structures, and ambiguous wording. Avoid using idioms and be straight to the point with what you want to
          convey in the text. Because reading comprehension can be an area of difficulty for people with ASD, we need
          to structure the content in a way that's as clear as possible for them to understand.
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-around border p-5 m-3 bg-light">
          <div class="d-inline-flex flex-column">

          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="pb-3">Finally, use clear, concise instructions on buttons. It can be helpful for there to be visual
          cues in
          buttons as well, as long as the visual cue is clear and is accompanied with supporting text. It should be
          clear what every element on a page does. For example, there shouldn't be buttons with just icons that
          explain what they do. Because predictive impairment can be a shared characteristic among individuals with
          ASD, it might not be clear to them what a button or element does when they interact with it unless that's
          specifically stated on the element.

        <h3 class="pt-3">What about communicating directly, whether that be through emails or phone calls?</h3>
        <p>
          Even if we aren't the ones writing the content for the sites that we build, we might have website users with
          ASD who want to communicate directly with us, whether that be for feedback purposes or questions about the
          content on the site. We can make this easier by having a clear section on the site to take feedback from
          users. Here's one tip on how to better communicate through email with those with ASD.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use straightforward language when communicating, whether that be through emails or phone calls. Avoid
          excessive jargon, metaphors, or ambiguous phrases that could be confusing or misinterpreted. If you're writing
          an email, organize it using clear headings, bullet points, or numbered lists. If the email involves scheduling
          a follow-up, provide clear details about the time, location, and any specific agenda items.

        <p>
          When designing an online product, we need to take into account sensory sensitivities that individuals with
          ASD may experience by avoiding the use of excessive audio, flashing lights, or bright colors that could be
          overstimulating. It would also be helpful to provide options to adjust or mute audio, control visual effects
          and colors, or manage sensory input in other ways. For example, the site could have options for users to
          take sensory breaks, pause or save progress, and return to the site when ready. This abides by UDL's
          guidelines to provide options for self regulation by facilitating pausing if necessary.
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-around border p-5 m-3 bg-light">

            <div id="hidden">Your progress has been saved!</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          It would also be helpful if the site offers customizable features that allow individuals with ASD to tailor
          the online experience to their specific needs. This might include options to adjust font sizes, color
          schemes, sound settings, and line spacing. Some individuals with ASD may be sensitive to certain sounds or
          colors. Offering the ability to adjust the website's features and design can create a more comfortable
          browsing experience for them. This feature would go with UDL's guidelines to provide options for perception
          by offering multiple ways to customize the site's features.

          Next, we should incorporate visuals on the site. This can include things like images or icons to supplement
          the content of the site and the elements on the page. These visuals can help individuals with ASD comprehend
          information, follow instructions, and understand what happens when interacting with certain parts of the
          site. This would go with UDL's guidelines to provide options for expression and communication by adding
          multiple ways to view information.

            <p>There is a fluffy cat. It's very fluffy and cute. Also, this is a bunch of random text. Why? Because I
              want to put a lot of words here to make a huge block of text that is hard to read. Here's even more
              text. And, more text. And, even more text. This is even more text. This is going to turn into a very big
              block of
              text about a cat. Here's more text by the way. And, here's even more text to make this text block a
              little bit bigger. How about some more text? And even more? What about some more text? This looks like
              it's about enough text to be considered a very big block of text without a picture or other visuals to
              accompany it.

          The overall design of the site should be uncluttered and organized; the site needs to minimize distractions
          and provide a clear focus. We can do this by using a consistent layout, simple navigation, and avoiding
          excessive visual stimuli. Elements like pop-up windows should be avoided. The more predictable and clear the
          website design is, the easier it would be for individuals with ASD to navigate it. The default design of the
          site should be clear by using sans-serif font faces or other clear typefaces.
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-around border p-5 m-3 bg-light">
          <div class="d-inline-flex flex-column">
            <p>Bad ❌</p>
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" id="popup">Click here!!! ⚠️</button>
          </div>
          <div class="d-inline-flex flex-column">
            <p>Bad ❌</p>
            <p class="cant-read-1">This text might be hard to read.</p>
            <p class="cant-read-2">So might this text.</p>
            <p class="cant-read-3">And... probably this text as well.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Finally, the site must maintain predictability and consistency in the way it's designed. Individuals with
          ASD often thrive in familiar environments where things are predictable. So, we need consistency in our
          website design for a better user experience. Specifically, for example, we can keep the nav bar on top and
          the footer on the bottom. If there are elements that show up after something gets clicked on the site, we
          can use visual indicators like progress bars to show what's happening. A success message or error
          notification can pop up at the end as well to make the flow of an individual's actions and the system's
          response clearer.

        <p>Here are some additional resources that can be helpful when making your own website to be more accesible.</p>

            It might be useful to listen to <a
              href="https://a11yrules.com/podcast/e31-interview-with-jamie-knight-part-1/" target=”_blank”>an episode of
              the
              Accessibility Rules podcast,</a> where Nic Steenhout
            interviews people that are involved with web accessibility. In particular, this interview with Jamie Knight,
            an autistic web developer, is very helpful for designing web pages for autistic people. It's interesting to
            listen to Knight's views on online accessibility because of their perspective as an autistic person. They
            talk about how they became a web developer, the principles they keep in mind as they create sites, and their
            experience as an autistic person in web development.

            Here's a <a href="https://github.com/otsimo/autism-colors" target=”_blank”>GitHub repository</a> with code
            that generates
            colors that are friendly for people with ASD. A <a href="https://issuu.com/gaarchitects4/docs/mla-presentation-november-2010-low- 
            " target=”_blank”>study</a> by
            GA Architects, a group of architects specialized in building sensory-friendly environments for children and
            adults with ASD, it was found that subdued and colors mixed with gray were favored by children with autism,
            there was a preference for colors in the blue/green hue sectors, and a balance between colourfulness and
            grayness was seen to be popular. This open-source color generator takes those points into account in order
            to generate colors that are less likely to cause sensory overstimulation.

            This is a <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target=”_blank”>color contrast checker
              tool</a> that you
            can use to check if the text and elements on your site are
            contrasted enough for them to be accessible. This site was developed by WebAIM, the Institute for Disability
            Research, Policy, and Practice at Utah State University. This tool checks the colors of the background
            against the text colors in order to see if they abide by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
            This resource can help prevent sensory overload or underload which individuals with ASD might experience.
